Welcome to the Azure AI Vision OCR sample repository!

This repository contains sample Python code that demonstrates Azure AI Vision using optical character recogniztion or OCR to read words from images.  The sample application will then return the words and provide the location of the words on the image and the confidence level, which can be used to determine precision of the OCR. 

Download the files to a directory, ensure that the appropriate modules are pip'ed and run the py file.
